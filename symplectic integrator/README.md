# Symplectic Integrator

This symplectic integrator utilizes the Democratic Heliocentric method, see (Duncan, et al.)
To run this code, load symplectic_integrator.py into a python interpreter and run it in a folder called src. In the same directory level as src, it will output plots into a folder called plots as a png, visualizing the 3:2 Neptune-Pluto Resonance as well as change in system energy over time.
